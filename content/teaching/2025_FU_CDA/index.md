### Course Description
Categorical Data Analysis is a fundamental course in statistical data analysis, along with regression analysis. While regression analysis (and ANOVA) deals with continuous response variables, categorical data analysis focuses on discrete response variables (such as binary, multinomial, and count data), exploring various methodologies for their analysis.

---

### Learning Objectives
- To develop the ability to apply and interpret categorical data analysis techniques using R (or Python) through practical data analysis.
- To build upon regression analysis by understanding and applying the framework of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs).
