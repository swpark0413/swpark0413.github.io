### Course Description
This course covers the fundamental theories and practical implementation methods of Bayesian statistics, introducing key concepts such as Bayes’ theorem, prior and posterior distributions, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and Bayesian model selection. Along with theoretical understanding, students will develop the ability to apply Bayesian methods to real-world problems through data analysis exercises using Python.

---

### Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Understand the principles of Bayes’ theorem and explain the roles of prior and posterior distributions.
- Design Bayesian models, select appropriate prior distributions, and perform posterior inference.
- Understand computational techniques such as MCMC and use them to estimate complex posterior distributions.
- Implement Bayesian analysis using Python and apply it to real-world datasets.
